# NewType-36
NewType-36, a nowt36 variant with an integrated 36mm trackball, individual 36 RGBs & powered by WS RP2040 Zero

# Description
NewType-36, a modified [nowt36](https://github.com/tamago324/nowt36) that was originally designed by tamago324.
The following designs were modified by me and I got the blessing from tamago324 for the modifications:

-NewType-36 PCB was design by using the nowt36 pcb files as reference and EasyEDA was used to designed the NewType-36 to include a integrated PMW3360 trackball sensor.

-MCU changed from Pro Micron to Waveshare RP2040 Zero that is to be smd soldered onto the keyboard pcb.

-Heavily modifed case by Sato to have an integrated trackball holder module with an integrated 5mm thick switch plate.

-The case will have a notch cut out to display the solder MCU and exposed USB C connector of the MCU.

-The case consists of 2 pieces that is secured by having M2 screws in the hot inserts that are melted into the case.

# Status
Currently the JLCPCB printed 5 PCBs are in transit and the case is already printed.
QMK source code complied into firmware and both will be uploaded.

# Renders
