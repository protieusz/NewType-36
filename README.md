# Description
NewType-36, a modified [nowt36](https://github.com/tamago324/nowt36) that was originally designed by tamago324.
The following designs were modified by me and I got the blessing from tamago324 for the modifications:

-NewType-36 PCB was design by using the nowt36 pcb files as reference and EasyEDA was used to designed the NewType-36 to include a integrated PMW3360 trackball sensor.

-MCU changed from Pro Micron to Waveshare RP2040 Zero that is to be smd soldered onto the keyboard pcb.

-Heavily modifed case by Sato to have an integrated trackball holder module with an integrated 5mm thick switch plate.

-The case will have a notch cut out to display the solder MCU and exposed USB C connector of the MCU.

-The case consists of 2 pieces that is secured by having M2 screws in the hot inserts that are melted into the case.

-QMK source code was borrowed from bally by aki27 and the mod done was implement NewType-36's key matrix layout into [bally](https://github.com/aki27kbd/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/aki27/bally)'s code. No support will be giving for QMK questions. I just copy and pasted the code. For QMK support, it is best to ask QMK Discord Community.

-Warning: Print at your own risk. PCB print and build worked on my end. A lot of factors can happen during pcb manufacture, 3D printing, etc. Files are public so make use at your own risk.

# Status
PCBs received on Apr 26, 2024.  Assemble, soldered and build by me.

Currently the JLCPCB printed 5 PCBs are in transit and the case is already printed.
QMK source code complied into firmware and both of them were uploaded.
